###  Purpose

- To create a web version of the classic Windows Minesweeper game that I frequently played.
- To understand that, while the game appears simple on the surface, its internal implementation can be challenging.
- To implement the game using plain JavaScript without relying on external libraries.

### Tech Stack

> HTML, CSS, Javascript

  - If the surrounding mine count is 0, all adjacent cells open.
